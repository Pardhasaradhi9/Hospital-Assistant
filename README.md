# Hospital Chatbot: Your Personal Healthcare Assistant
## Overview:
The Hospital Chatbot is an interactive conversational agent designed to assist users with common healthcare queries. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this chatbot provides prompt responses to user inquiries related to adverse drug reactions, blood pressure monitoring, pharmacy locations, and hospital information.

## Features:
### Intent Recognition: 
  #### The chatbot accurately recognizes user intents, even if the input matches just 50% of the intent, ensuring relevant responses.
### Dataset-driven Responses: 
  #### Built upon a curated dataset, the chatbot offers insights and information on various healthcare topics.
### Simple Exception Handling: 
  #### While the chatbot's knowledge is based on the dataset it was trained on, it can handle simple exceptions gracefully.
### User-Friendly Interaction: 
  #### With an intuitive interface, users can engage in natural, conversational interactions with the chatbot.

## Approach:
### Data Preparation: 
  #### Extracted and processed a dataset of common healthcare queries and responses.
### Model Training: 
  #### Utilized a machine learning model to train the chatbot on the dataset, enabling it to recognize user intents.
### Response Generation: 
  #### Developed functions to predict intents and retrieve responses based on user input.
### Interactive Interface: 
  #### Implemented an interactive loop allowing users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly within the terminal itself.

## Technologies Used:
#### Python
#### Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK)
#### Keras (for model training)
#### TensorFlow (for deep learning)
#### JSON (for dataset storage)

## Usage:
#### Clone the repository to your local machine.
#### Install the necessary dependencies, have a look at "ipynb" file
#### Run the main script to interact with the chatbot.
